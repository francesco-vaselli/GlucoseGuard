# GlucoseGuard

The following pages describe the work done by me as part of the [Statistical and Machine Learning Models for Time Series Analysis](https://www.sns.it/en/corsoinsegnamento/statistical-and-machine-learning-models-time-series-analysis) PhD Exam.

The reliable prediction of glucose levels in diabetes patients remains a pivotal challenge in biomedical engineering and healthcare informatics. Traditional predictive models have often suffered from inaccuracies and an inability to generalize across different physiological characteristics inherent in patient-specific data. The implications of these shortcomings are nontrivial and bear significant ramifications for clinical decision-making.
In the following, we start from a reference paper and we try to reproduce and expand the work already done, to achieve accurate and roboust time series forcasting for blood sugar levels prediction.

We acknowledge the use of the [OpenAPS Data Commons](https://openaps.org/outcomes/data-commons/) dataset, and we would like to publicy thank the authors and the contributors for the effort of gathering many real-world data and making them more accesible.

Part of the codebase is inspired from [AccurateBG](https://github.com/yixiangD/AccurateBG/tree/main) which is released under MIT license
